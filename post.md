> We believe you are responsible enough to operate and track your own 
billable AirPair hours! Read this guide to save you and your customers time
and confusion. The smoother you operate according to this guide the faster
you'll get paid and probably rebooked for more pairing hours!

## 1. What is ***Spinning*** ?

<!-- More playing from author.airpair looks like some auto sync going on -->

### 1.1 Origins & evolution

The term *Spinning* originally came from the usage: 

> "**Let me** ***spin*** **you up a** google **hangout** for your AirPair session!"

These days AirPair `bookings` facilitate a broader set of services than 
the traditional live pairing session. Bookings are a way to get
paid without fuss for online and offline software services including but not 
limited to:

- Live `pairing` (online via a screensharing tool) 
- 1-to-many `workshops` (online via Hangouts) 
- `chat` support (online via Slack) 
- Prototyping / `research` (offline)
- Async `code-review` (offline via GitHub) 
- `coding` features (offline) 
- `authoring` guides / tutorials / documentation (offline) 


<!--
- - -
**Tip ** If you were familiar with the pre-2015 AirPair, `bookings` were 
designed to be totally seperate from `requests`. This means that customers
do not need to provide new requirements to rebook you. In fact, if a 
customer is familiar with you but not AirPair, you can be booked direclty 
without a customer needing to make a request.
-->

### 1.2 Getting paid (via Escrow)

If you follow the flow and train customers to play along, AirPair facilitates 
instant pay for completed work, in increments of your preference between 30 mins 
and 20 hrs.

1.2.1 ** Happy customers == instant pay **

<!--Different actions are detailed for different booking types and
tools (if any) that your customer chooses when they book you.-->

If all else fails, the single step that still ensures you get paid is getting your customers `release` payment for a booking from escrow <sup>Release Payment Step as described in the expert guide</sup>.

1.2.2 ** Manage bookings up-front **

Bookings represent funds collected and already set aside in escrow for payment 
to you. If there is no booking, you cannot get paid. AirPair will not 
retroactively ask customers to create bookings for payment you claim you
are owed. It is your responsibility to make sure you are booked for the full
amount of time with which you have expectations of being paid for.

1.2.3 ** Follow the guides **

The likelihood of getting assistance from AirPair staff in situations where 
payment is not immediately released will be reflected in how well you have 
followed the guidelines outlined in the Expert Guide <sup>AirPair [Expert Guide](/expert-guide)</sup> and sections below.

## 2. Expectations & professionalism

Your AirPair `Mojo` <sup>The [Expert mojo api](https://github.com/airpair/experts.airpair.com/blob/master/docs/api/experts/mojo.md) and the number of pairs you get.</sup> and future success in getting 
pairs is tightly bound with sticking in these boundaries.

### 2.1 Showing up

We will deduct $30 from your payouts and credit your customer each time you
miss a session. Missing sessions will quickly reduce the number of new pairing
opportunties.

### 2.2 Rescheduling

You are generally expected not to reschedule customers, but if necessarily
to work within the following boundaries:

1. If rescheduling is necessary you must notify your customer and 
@customer-support via chat with at least 24 hours notice.
2. Under exceptional circumstances (baby on the way / traffic jam etc.) 
**let your pair know *via your chat room* ** at least a half hour before why
you will not be able to attend.
3. Radio silence leading up to and past your scheduled time will likely lead to no more pairing.
4. Stopping /breaking mid-session for more than 1-2 minutes (e.g. to take phone  calls) or change locations is not acceptable.
5. Ending early to reschedule will entitle the customer to the original
full booking length at the rescheduled time or to swap and try a new expert 
without you getting paid or a full refund.

** Tip ** The sooner you let your customer and us know (via chat) that you 
cannot make a session the greater chance there is to find and swap to an alternate expert.

### 2.3 Audio & Video

We expect your audio and video to be working and clear. You are responsible
for having enough bandwidth and pre-testings ahead of time and that the audio 
and video are not inhibiting communications.

### 2.4 Punctuality

**{ ON TIME IS EARLY }**

We respect expert time more than similar platforms <sup>Unlike other platforms [AirPair favors experts](/expert-guide).</sup>. Customers are made aware that
your time is precious and the clock starts ticking immediately from at your scheduled time.

Be online in your chat room **10 minutes before your session** to:

- To account for clock misalignment
- Buffer time for smooth set up 
- Last minute ping missing parties accidently distracted, but readily available if poked <sup>Sometimes we developers can get lost in code and not notice the time/</sup>.

### 2.5 Late customers & no-shows

By being on-time, you also have no obligation to stay later than scheduled, even if customers are a few minutes late.

When your session recording has started on time, and a customer is later than 
15 minutes, you may end the call and collect your full booking payment after
mentioning @customer-service in chat to let alter of the no-show.

### 2.6 Stick to PAID time

With no expectations, if you need a few extra minutes and are eager to use them 
to successfully wrap up a session we are ok for you to go up to 15 minutes.

If you think it will take more than an extra 15 minutes, 5 minutes before 
the end of the original session ends, ask the customer if they wish
to book more time <sup>See Rebooking in the Expert Guide</sup>. Solved or not, 
if a customer does not wish to rebook, we expect you to wrap up no later 
than 15 minutes over.

Providing free time is frowned upon. Most scenarios around experts wanting to 
give additional follow on free time result from lack of expertise which
ultimately reflects poorly on the platform and often aggravate customers. 
Only volunteer on requirements you are very confident with. Customers sometimes 
try to extract value in chat before the actual paid sessions. Use your 
intuition to chat for enough time to answer pre-session questions to set 
yourself up for success. Do not spend unaccounted hours going through the 
customers code and if necessary book offline time.

## 3. Tools for AirPairing Sessions

Live Pairing sessions by default are conducted through **AirPair Integrated 
Google Hangouts** on Air. Hangouts are currently the only system integrated into our automated workflow. Recordings are automatically given to the customer in the airpair.com UI for reference. They also help resolve disputes and track fulfilment.

### 3.1 New customers

We encourage Hangouts for first interactions as the video is great for building initial human connection / trust.

AirPair has a money back-gaurantee <sup>See AirPair's Refund Policy for deatils on Money Back Gaurantee</sup> for the first hour with any new 
expert and new customers are just getting introduced to ideas like escrow. 
Sticking to the basic automatated flow with new customers particularly 
increases the efficiency and reduces risk of getting paid.

### 3.2 With return customers

#### 3.2.1 Pairing tool of choice

After the first session we recommend you use the pairing/ screen-share 
tool of choice between you and your customer.

#### 3.2.2 Why stick with Hangouts?

1. If the customer wants recordings accessible from their AirPair dashboard 
2. If additional participants are required


## 4. Spin your own Hangout

### 4.1 Use our integrated workflow !!

** Our custom flow**:
- Save time automatically setting up details like inviting the 
right emails.
- Integrates with and updates the state of your chat room and the airpair.com UI.
- Triggers *@pairbot* to follow up with customers until they release your pay.

** Normal hangouts via gchat / g+ or slack means**:
- Recordings will not be accessible to the customer
- We are unlikely to help with payouts without the interactions tracked and accessible for reference.

### 4.2 Instructions

#### 4.2.1 The *secret* entrance

**Note that self-spinning only works 25 minutes before through to 15 minutes 
after your confirmed time.** Outside that range or if logged in with the 
wrong email (e.g. a different google account not associated with the 
booking) and you will see a blank page.

To enter the self spinning flow add `/spin` at
the end of your booking url and. For example take:

<pre>
https://www.airpair.com/bookings/54fe3005058e3f0c003218ac
</pre>

Either of the following url formats logged in as you will enter the flow:
<pre>
https://www.airpair.com/bookings/54fe3005058e3f0c003218ac<b style="color:#c7254e">/spin</b>

http://booking.airpa.ir/54fe3005058e3f0c003218ac<b style="color:#c7254e">/spin</b>
</pre>

Once entered the feature is self documented. It is very straightforward 
if you are aware of the Gotchas below.

#### 4.2.2 Timely creation and recording

Both the time you create and begin, recording is recorded captured by the 
Hangouts API and stored for the `AirPair Mojo API` <sup>3</sup>.

** 10 mins before ** your Hangout *should* be ready. 10 minutes is a good
buffer for special use cases (see 4.4) and troubleshooting (see 4.5). 

@pairbot will automatically shared your hangout link. ** If you don't
see @pairbot say your hangout is ready, you have missed something and should start again from the beginning.

** By the confirmed time **, press the green "Start Broadcast" button to
begin recording. Hangouts are made private after your broadcast is complete.
The odds of someone seeing your session live are slim to nil. 

If you and your pair are set up and ready you may begin recording early. If 
your pair is not present or still setting up, begin recording when the clock 
hits the confirmed time.

** Tip 1 ** If it is your first time self spinning, set up your hangout 20 
minutes before. Once familiar it should take comfortably less than 3 minutes.
- - -
** Tip 2 ** If your customer explicitly asks you not to record the hangout
because of IP or code privacy, please record the beginning of the hangout 
then press "Stop broadcast" when you begin to cover sensitive information. 
- - -
** Tip 3 ** Historically customers are uncomfortable with / refusing to use video
have caused problems. Try flag if the customer has issues with 
@customer-service during onboarding (section 5) and not at the last moment.

### 4.3 Gotchas

1) Though the self-spin flow invites your personal email to the hangout, 
**use 1 hangout window** logged in as the @airpair.com account. 2 hangout
windows will cause an echo. Closing the incognito @airpair.com window and 
re-joining with your personal g+ email will stop the recording.

2) Remember to **open a fresh incognito window** with the link you are given in
the second step. If you have another incognito window lying around and
signed into another google account, the flow will fail and you will
not see pairbot in chat.

3) **Popup Blockers** and AdBlockers may hinder the Hangout API from opening 
a new window for the Hangout.

### 4.4 Special use-cases

Eventually these scenarios will be automated, customers have been told in
"the fine print" on the booking page to flag these situations in chat ahead
of time.

To add additional emails, after you've started your hangout manually click 
invites in the hangout UI and paste in the additional emails they provide.

<!-- Insert invite pictures -->

#### 4.4.1 Alternate g+ friendly emails 

Often customers sign up with email addresses or corporate accounts that are
not g+ enabled and thus cannot be used to access the hangout. Ask the customer for an alternate (usually personal gmail) address and manually invite that
address from the hangout UI.

#### 4.4.2 Additional participants

Manually invite addresses from the hangout UI that are provided for colleagues
to join.

<!--
#### 4.4.3 Duplicate accounts

Occasionally users
-->

### 4.5 Troubleshooting hangouts

Hangouts can be flakey and even experienced experts and we've watched 
experienced experts have random difficulties that delayed sessions from starting. 
Most issues are solved with:

1. (First call) Confirming the customer is logged into google and joining
as the same email address on the booking.
2. (2nd call) Quitting and reopening the browser
3. (3rd call) Trying a different browser
3. (Last resort) Rebooting

## 5 Onboarding

## 6 Follow up

You will get an email when a new booking is made. Make sure that
booking is associated with either a new room you create or an existing one.

Open the link in the email.

** Create a new room (group) **

Sometimes the expert is not yet part of our slack.. Invite them using the
invite to slack.

If you invited them already and after 2 hours they are not in slack
send a manual email from gmail asking them to sign in.

To see when users have joined slack, go to airpair-channel and look
down the bottom.

** Associate an existing room (group) **
